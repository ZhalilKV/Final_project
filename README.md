TITLE : FitTrack

DESCRIPTION 

Fit Track is a desktop-based fitness tracking application , designed to help users monitor and improve their physical well-being. The application enables users to log and manage their workouts, track nutritional intake, and analyze progress over time through visual reports and data summaries.

PURPOSE
The main goal of Fit Track is to provide an intuitive and interactive platform where users can:
1. Log daily workouts and exercises.
2. Record meals and calculate caloric intake.
3. Monitor progress with charts and reports.
4. Maintain consistent fitness habits using data-driven insights.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS LIST 

1) User Account Management (Add, edit, and delete user profiles (name, age, weight, etc.).

2) Workout Logging System (Record workouts with type, duration, date, and calories burned).

3) Nutrition Tracking (Log meals with nutritional information like calories, protein, carbs, and fats).

4) Database Integration (Store and retrieve data using SQLite with at least 3 well-structured tables (e.g., users, workouts, meals).

5) DAO (Data Access Object) Pattern

6) GUI with PyQt5 and Qt Designer
A fully functional, user-friendly interface with input fields, buttons, and tables.

7) MVC Architecture Implementation
Clear separation between Models, Views (GUI), and Controllers for better code organization.

8) Data Validation
Ensure that only valid data (e.g., positive numbers for age, calories) can be entered and saved.

9) Reports and Charts with Matplotlib
Display visual progress reports (e.g., weight change over time, calorie intake trends).

11) Unit Testing for Core Modules
Test key components such as models and database operations to ensure reliability.
